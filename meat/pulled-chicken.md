Mainly inspired by [playswellwithbutter](https://playswellwithbutter.com/shredded-bbq-chicken-recipe/), tweaked by me

## Extra
I am not providing amounts because I eyeballed everything. I used like 3 kg of chicken.

The rub combination is personal and everyone has different tastes. For me, the proportions were 3:1:5, 3 of paprika, garlic, onion, rosemary, 1 of cayenne, and 5 of the rest. Feel free to try with other spices as well (these were the only ones available to me at the time I did this recipe).

Similarly with the bbq sauce. I actually mixed two different bbq sauces and added honey, soy sauce and lemon juice until I liked the taste.

Since I prepared this one day in advance, I warmed up the chicken the next day in a pot with the broth.
