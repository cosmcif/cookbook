# Yogurt fruit cake

- 180 g sugar or 90 g fructose
- 250 g yogurt
- 100 g melted butter
- 16 g baking powder
- fruit
- optional: vanilla sugar

## What do
- mix eggs and sugar
- add yogurt
- add butter
- sift and add flour
- add baking powder
- mix
- put batter in a greased pan
- add fruit on top
- cook for 45 mins in a preheated ventilated oven at 170°C or in a static oven at 180°C
- let rest n eat

## Notes
If you put just a little fruit or none, cook for 30-35 minutes first and then check if it's still raw. If you cover the top in fruit then cook for at least 45 mins, but potentially more.

Tastes better with some chocolate spread!
